## Build on OS X

### Install Homebrew

The [recommended way of installing the Homebrew OS X package manager](http://brew.sh/) is via Terminal command:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

#### About Homebrew

Homebrew is tractable. The standard script installs Homebrew to `/usr/local` so that sudo is not required for `brew install`. It is a careful script, it can be run even if other packages have already been installed to `/usr/local`. It informs the user exactly what it will do before it does it, enabling the user to confirm the details before permitting brew to execute the action.

#### How do I uninstall Homebrew?

To uninstall Homebrew, paste the command below in a terminal prompt.
     
     ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"

By default, this command will uninstall homebrew and remove its footprint, i.e. will remove brew and restore `/usr/local` to its prior state.
